Hi folks!

I'm Matt, and I'm a robotics researcher and software engineer.

I'm a senior in CS at the University of Colorado Boulder. I relentlessly pursue both solid research and robust, maintainable code.

## Research

At CU, I work as an undergraduate researcher in the [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/) and [SBS](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs/) labs.

My research in the HIRO lab encompasses two directions:

1. Research on the calibration and application of a flexible robotic skin for robotic manipulators

2. Soft hiearchical reinforcement learning (HRL) with quadrotors for improved learning.

My work in the SBS lab is primarily targeted at building energy simulation, via machine learning and deep learning models. I've worked on genetic algorithms to a variety of GANs (Generative Adverserial Networks) in order to completely avoid computationally expensive energy simulations -- that often may take days to weeks.


In my free time, I enjoy running, biking, swimming, and working out.

Mamba Mentality!
