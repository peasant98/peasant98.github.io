I'm Matt (司马修), and I'm a software engineer at Microsoft and robotics researcher.

During my undergrad at the University of Colorado Boulder, I worked in the [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one) group as an undergraduate researcher, advised by Professor [Alessandro Roncone](https://alessandro.ronc.one/). I was also a researcher in the [SBS](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs) lab, advised by Professor [Wangda Zuo](https://www.colorado.edu/ceae/wangda-zuo). Along the way, I interned a couple of times at Microsoft.

My research involves enabling perception and autonomy for physical human-robot interaction. On the side, I work on leveraging machine learning as applied to building energy modeling.

I enjoy running, biking, swimming, hiking, and some climbing. Check out my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26495451)!

My best languages: Python, C++, Typescript, C#, 中文 (in progress)
