**I'm a Computer Science PhD in Robotics and AI at Stanford University**. I am currently advised by [Monroe Kennedy](https://profiles.stanford.edu/monroe-kennedy) and [Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/). I am interesting in constructing rich visual-tactilel representations for dexterous manipulation, and using those representations to imbue robots with the ability to perform fine-grained tasks.

Prior to this, I worked at **Microsoft as a Software Engineer** in Redmond on the Customer Experience Platform. Before this, during my undergrad at the University of Colorado Boulder, I worked in the [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one) group as an undergraduate researcher, advised by Professor [Alessandro Roncone](https://alessandro.ronc.one/). I was also a researcher in the [SBS](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs) lab, advised by Professor [Wangda Zuo](https://www.colorado.edu/ceae/wangda-zuo).

 

I enjoy running, trail running, frisbee, biking, swimming, and hiking. Check out my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26495451)!

My best languages: Python, C++, Typescript, C#, 中文 (in progress)
