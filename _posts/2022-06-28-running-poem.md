## The Run

<i>I’m out alone<br>
Feet are pounding<br>
Heart is racing<br>
Body is sweating.<br>

<i>The miles slowly inch by<br>
One by one<br>
And I admire the trees <br>
As they tower along my sides.<br>

<i>I feel the air in my face<br>
Crisp, clean, and clear<br>
I’m in a zone<br>
I’m in my own world<br>

<i>I reflect on my life<br>
The long hot Colorado summers<br>
The brutal runs<br>
But here I am, in the lovely PNW.<br>

<i>I think about the end<br>
My adrenaline will run out then!<br>
I’ll surely be reduced to an old man.<br>

<i>But the water will embrace me<br>
The imaginary gatorade will satisfy me<br>
The energy bars will save me.<br>

<i>But I don’t want that.<br>
<i>I’m enjoying this vibe<br>
<i>Because even though my body’s dead inside<br>
<i>Mentally, I’ve never felt more alive.<br>
