# 10 Lessons from 2024

<img src="/files/bunny_images/bunny1.jpg" alt="Bunny"> 

1. Sometimes your momentum is so high in a day that you might as well keep pushing and seeing what good stuff what you can get done. Take the heat check!

2. Back in 2012, <b>LeBron "King" James</b> faced one of his most legacy-defining moments -- he was down 3-2 to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, playing them at home, with the haters ready to proclaim him as one of the biggest sports failures in history. With his back against the wall, LeBron responds with a 45 point masterpiece, pushing the series to a Game 7, which he then wins en route to his first of 4 championships. There was nothing to do but win that game. Sometimes, we just need to tap into that "I'm gonna will it to happen".

3. Time passes faster because the brain can go through experiences on autopilot if they've been experienced before; it's more efficient. Then that chaotic day comes along, and that day is bad, but it becomes unforgettable. 

4. It seems that eating greens before the carbs and proteins improves digestion. My little brother and I have started the <b>"Green Primer"</b>, where we eat a bunch of leafy greens before an unhealthy meal out. Back to my 18 year old self!

5. <b>Sometimes your best will simply not be enough</b>. And you will need to take a big break, relearn some things, and realize that you should tackle a different problem.

6. As you get a lot of cool novel experiences in life out of the way by 25, for the moment to be magic, it sometimes take a bit more work, but oh boy, does it HIT. 

7. Some people are simply way, way better than stuff you want to be great at. They also are willing to sacrifice more than you. It feels initially like getting into the NBA, which requires being excellent through grade school and college,  and realizing that you'll be a role player, but let's remember that <b>you win championships with great role players</b>.

8. The worst effect of poor sleep, to me, is the inability to form new, profound memories. Sometimes a cool life experience happens when you are super tired, you don't enjoy it as much, but then it happens for the second time when you are NOT tired. And the moment is not as enjoyable.


9. The reward in the process should feel like a nice little bonus. There should never be a final reward, just a steady of stream of contentness from increased competency at what you are doing.

10. To me, I think a life well lived will be one where I <b>improve my life</b> (maximize my potential), <b>improve others' lives </b> (family, loved ones), and <b>create life </b>(father).
