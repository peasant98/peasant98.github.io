Welcome to my personal blog! I will be posting about my research, art, photography, personal musings, and more!

To start, here is one of my poems:

===========================================

## The Mentor

<i>I dream of a mountain<br>
Incomprehensible beauty<br>
Towering over it all<br>
They want to view it<br>
I want to conquer it.<br>

<i>My life is now the mountain<br>
One goal<br>
One purpose<br>
One mission.<br>

<i>Then I’m ready<br>
Impossible to fail<br>

<i>I run like a deer<br>
Then that lovely mountain, she turns against me<br>
I walk like a zombie<br>
Then that perfect mountain, she doesn’t want me<br>
I crawl like a baby<br>
Inch by inch<br>
Until the mountain says,<br> 
“No”.

<i>I fall from my spot<br>
Thousands of feet in the air<br>
What did I do wrong?<br>
That pristine peak becomes a nice dream<br>
And I’m back home.<br>

<i>A hand reaches out to me<br>
A hand that’s already conquered the mountain<br>
A hand that knows every route, every way<br>
And I now know<br>
It’s not about the mountain.<br>
