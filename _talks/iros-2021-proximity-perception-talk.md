At the IROS 2021 4th Workshop on Proximity Perception in Robotics, Caleb Escobedo (my colleague in the HIRO group) and I presented a talk on Contact Anticipation for Physical Human-Robot Interaction with Robotic Manipulators using Onboard Proximity Sensors. The talk covered our last year of research in close proximity human robot interaction.
